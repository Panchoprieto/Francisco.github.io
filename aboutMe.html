            <p id="midI">Now a little about me. </p>
            <p id="botI">I was born on the 10th of April 2001 in the city of Azogues, Canar on the mountains of Ecuador taking my name after my grandfather. When I was roughly 2 years of ages my family immigrated to the states for more opportunities and a better life. Some time passed an am now a student, more say senior, at All City Leadership Secondary School (H.S) in Brooklyn NY with around a GPA of 3.5. I entered high school in September 2015 and am expected to graduate in June 2019.
Some of my hobbies include hanging around and spending time with family and friends playing games or just engaging in conversations. I also enjoy learning new and interesting facts relating to history or science.</p>
